# Eclipse 2024.1

Eclipse is a pioneering application designed to guide customers through the lifecycle of their machines, transitioning from a singular assessment tool to a comprehensive suite of micro sales enablement apps. This evolution positions Eclipse not just as an evaluative tool, but as a platform for both Hexagon's employees and customers to explore, assess, and enhance their equipment's capabilities through targeted solutions.

## About

- [Manufacturing Intelligence | Hexagon](https://hexagon.com/company/divisions/manufacturing-intelligence)

Eclipse serves as a bridge between Hexagon and its customers, offering a nuanced understanding of machine performance, future-readiness, and alignment with Hexagon's cutting-edge solutions. Through detailed assessments and recommendations, Eclipse empowers users to make informed decisions regarding upgrades, replacements, and services, ensuring their machinery remains at the forefront of manufacturing excellence.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Machine Lifecycle Assessment**: At the conclusion of a service and calibration visit, Eclipse provides a detailed score or rating based on critical parameters such as frame type, controller, PCDMIS version, and year of manufacture. This score acts as a Future Proof Indicator, helping customers gauge their machine's position within Hexagon's CMM product line.

- **Tailored Recommendations**: Based on the assessment, Eclipse suggests services, contracts, and upgrades most suited to the machine's current lifecycle stage. Recommendations may include retrofit controllers, new machines for unsupported frames, PCDMIS software training, or interim servicing solutions.

- **Automation ROI Screen**: A new feature that embodies Eclipse's evolution into a suite of micro sales enablement apps. This tool allows both Hexagon employees and customers to assess the return on investment (ROI) of automating their machinery, further enhancing the decision-making process with quantitative insights.

- **Direct Engagement**: Following an assessment, customers have the option to request a callback from a technical sales manager for a detailed discussion on the recommendations, or directly receive a quote tailored to their needs. This direct line of communication ensures clarity, trust, and responsiveness in addressing customer requirements.

## Vision

Eclipse is envisioned not merely as an assessment tool but as an ecosystem of micro-services designed to facilitate a comprehensive sales enablement platform. Each component within Eclipse aims to equip Hexagon's employees and customers with the necessary tools and insights to optimize their machinery investments, fostering informed decision-making and strategic planning for future readiness and sustainability.
